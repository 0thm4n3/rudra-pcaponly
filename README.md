Rudra: The Destroyer of Evil
============================

Rudra aims to provide a developer-friendly framework for exhaustive analysis of test files. Initial releases will primarily focus on building a robust analysis architecture and support for application/*.pcap files. Later versions will add analysis capabilities for application/{octet-stream, pdf, zip,} and possibly other filetypes.

The [Calculate File Entropy](http://www.kennethghartman.com/calculate-file-entropy/) post by Kenneth Hartman was also extremely helpful and it inspired me to include entropy/minsize/compressionratio statistics in generated reports.
